          <h2>Who Am I? (WIP)</h2>
          <p class="spacer">My name is Rachel!</p>
          <p class="spacer">Currently, I'm a lead for the p5.js Editor. I will provide a brief overview on my journey that led me here.</p>
          <p class="spacer">Was interested in art as a child. Discouraged from pursuing STEM oriented subjects by family. Led to studying art history in college.</p>
          <p class="spacer">In undergraduate program, was not too invested in art history major. Took a CS course, was interested in the professor talking about working with art and code. Took more CS courses to explore this but was disappointed by reality vs expectations.</p>
          <p class="spacer">Discovered ITP, applied looking to further explore museum technology. First semester ICM course was taught by Cassie, who created the p5.js editor. This course and overall program completely changed my outlook on programming. Was introduced to open source and programming.</p>
          <p class="spacer">Applied to GSoC in 2019. Continued contributing back to p5.js project as a GSoC Mentor. </p>
          <p class="spacer">Worked within education technology startups for around 3 years, wanted to explore a more accessible and community oriented approach to developing educational tools.</p>
