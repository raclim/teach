      <h1>Origins of Open Source</h1>

        <h2>How Did Open Source Get Started?</h2>
        <p>In the 1980's, some software developers noticed a troubling trend: the software industry was gravitating more and more towards creating proprietary software. This presented a few problems: </p>
        <p>First, if the developers noticed a bug in the software they were using, it was impossible for them to fix it themselves. They would have to wait for the company that created it to release a new version, which could take motnhs or years. 
            - Second: if the company that created the software went out of business, the developers would either be stuck with old software, or buy new one from a dif company. </p>
        <p>While many open source projects are software projects, the concept of "open source" can be applied to many disciplines. For example, hardware specifications, such as 3D printer models, can also be open source, as can data sets and other digital assets. </p>
        <p>At that time, it was called the "free software" movement, which laid the groundwork for what we now know as the "open source" movement.  </p>
        <p> The term "open source" was invented until the late 1990s. In 1998, the source code for the internet browser Netscape was made publicly available. Anticipating that other software projects would follow suit, an employee of Foresight Institute name Christine pitched the name"open source". </p>
        <p>By early 1998 theÂ [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/docs/osd)Â (OSI) was founded, formalizing the term open source and establishing a common, industry-wide definition. Though the open source movement was still met with wariness and corporate suspicion from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, it has steadily moved from the margins of software production to become the industry standard that it is today.</p>
