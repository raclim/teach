        <h2>What is Open Source?</h2>
        <p>Open Source software is software whose code is free to view, modify, and distribute. </p>
        <p>It's usually created and maintained by a community of volunteer software developers who callaborate on websites like Github. Anybody with an internet connection can view the code, and they can even suggest changes or point out issues can be fixed. </p>
        <p>While many open source projects are software projects, the concept of "open source" can be applied to many disciplines. For example, hardware specifications, such as 3D printer models, can also be open source, as can data sets and other digital assets. </p>
        <p>However, for this session, we will focus on the term "open source" in the context of software projects. </p>
        <p> Every active open source project has one or more maintainers. These are people who steward the project and make sure it remains free from bugs or other problems. In other words, they "maintain" the project! (diagram of open source)</p>

        <h2>What is it not?</h2>
        <p>It is not proprietary code, which is code only a few people can view and modify.</p>

        <h2>Why Would I Want to Get Involved?</h2>
        <p>Be involved with a community.</p>
        <p>Imporve coding and communication skills.</p>
        <p>Job and Career</p>
        <p>Contribute to creating software that can representative of you.</p>
